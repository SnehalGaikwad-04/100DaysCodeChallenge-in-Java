# 100DaysCodeChallenge-in-Java
I started this challenge when i started learning java and was a beginner in learning code itself, although i couldn't complete it consistently i will continue to upload java codes whenever i make them until i complete the 100 days despite it being not consistent. this repo is a compilation of past separate repos
